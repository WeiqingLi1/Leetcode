## 11. Container With Most Waterc

Medium

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

 



The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

#### Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

### Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        //two pointers
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        while(left < right) {
            int area = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
            if(area > maxArea) {
                maxArea = area;
            }
            //move pointer panel
            if(height[left] < height[right]) {
                int currHeight = height[left];
                do {
                    left++;
                } while(left < right && height[left] < currHeight);

            } else {
                int currHeight = height[right];
                do {
                    right--;
                } while(left < right && height[right] < currHeight);
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```
